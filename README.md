# Event Planner
deployed site: https://17anguyen.github.io/event-planner/

## Concept
Our concept is an event planner utilizing Google calendar and Google maps API.
 
This is a one-stop web page where the user can select the date of an event, plan the details by hour, select a location, and invite attendees via Google calendar. This simplifies the workflow for both business and casual users and can be used for both corporate and personal environments.
 
The core of the idea is that you would be able to schedule events and stay on task with the available task list and hourly calendar blocks in one place, as well as invite attendees and be reminded via Googleâ€™s calendar. 
 
This will allow a space where the corporate user can pick a place for an upcoming meeting such as a coworking space with notating meeting minutes without changing applications. At the same time, this will be a great resource for the everyday user to pick a great place to meet friends for dinner or plan a road trip with an agenda.
Target audience: corporate individuals and organized individuals.

## User Story

As a user and an organized individual, having a product that I can use for both personal and work to manage the events that I need to attend that will also upload to my calendar for notifications has been important for my time management. This makes scheduling events in my life with all of the details seamless.
In every event created, I can view the event title, the location of the event, the placeholders, and an hourly view of the event itself.
